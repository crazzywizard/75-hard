# Starting Weight Tracking Fixes

## Problem
Users were unable to add or edit starting weight for participants in the 75 Hard Challenge tracker application. The issues were:

1. **Adding participants**: The `AddParticipantForm` only had a User ID field but no starting weight field
2. **Editing starting weight**: Once a participant had entries logged, the `SetupChallenge` component was hidden and there was no way to edit the starting weight

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced AddParticipantForm
**File**: `src/components/AddParticipantForm.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added a starting weight input field to the participant creation form
- Added validation to ensure starting weight is provided and is greater than 0
- Updated the API call to include `start_weight` parameter
- Improved form layout to accommodate both User ID and starting weight fields

**Result**: Users can now set the starting weight when adding a new participant

### 2. Updated API Endpoint
**File**: `src/app/api/participants/route.ts`

**Changes**:
- Modified the POST endpoint to accept and handle the `start_weight` parameter
- Updated the insertion logic to include starting weight when creating participants

**Result**: Backend now properly stores starting weight during participant creation

### 3. Enhanced StatsDisplay Component
**File**: `src/components/StatsDisplay.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added inline editing capability for starting weight
- Added an edit button (✏️) next to the starting weight display
- Implemented save/cancel functionality with keyboard shortcuts (Enter to save, Escape to cancel)
- Added proper validation and error handling
- Only shows edit functionality when:
  - No end weight is set (challenge not completed)
  - onStartWeightChange callback is provided

**Result**: Users can now edit their starting weight at any time during the challenge

### 4. Updated Main Page Integration
**File**: `src/app/page.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Connected the StatsDisplay component to the existing `handleStartWeightChange` function
- Passed the weight change handler as a prop to enable inline editing

**Result**: Starting weight changes are properly saved and synchronized with the backend

## User Experience Improvements

### Before the Fix:
- Users could only set starting weight during initial setup
- Once entries were logged, starting weight became uneditable
- No starting weight field when adding participants

### After the Fix:
- Starting weight can be set when adding a new participant
- Starting weight can be edited at any time by clicking the edit button in the stats display
- Intuitive inline editing with visual feedback
- Keyboard shortcuts for faster editing (Enter/Escape)
- Proper validation ensures only valid weights are accepted

## Technical Details

### Validation Rules:
- Starting weight must be greater than 0
- Input accepts decimal values (step="0.1")
- Required field when adding participants

### UI/UX Features:
- Edit button only appears when editing is possible
- Inline editing maintains context
- Save/Cancel buttons for explicit control
- Auto-focus on edit input for better UX
- Responsive design works on mobile and desktop

### Data Flow:
1. User adds participant with starting weight → API stores data
2. User views stats → Starting weight displayed with edit option
3. User clicks edit → Inline input appears
4. User saves changes → Data updated via existing handleStartWeightChange function
5. Stats display refreshes with new weight

## Files Modified:
- `src/components/AddParticipantForm.tsx` - Added starting weight field
- `src/app/api/participants/route.ts` - Updated API to handle starting weight
- `src/components/StatsDisplay.tsx` - Added inline editing capability
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Connected StatsDisplay to weight change handler

These changes ensure users can properly manage starting weights throughout their 75 Hard Challenge journey.
